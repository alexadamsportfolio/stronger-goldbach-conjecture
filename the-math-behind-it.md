I came up with the following conjecture due to extreme boredom from having too much free time in my classes.

Take any even integer $2a$; what is the minimal number $n$ such that $(a-n)$ and $(a+n)$ are both prime? Having evaluated these values by hand for several hundred integers - and hundreds of thousands by the fprimes.cpp program - I have no reason to doubt that every single integer will be a value of $n$ (or $-n$, because $(a+n)+(a-n)=(a-n)+(a+n)$ ) for some even number. Of course, this assumes that every even number can be decomposed as a sum of a pair of primes - the Goldbach Conjecture.

It may initially seem useless to find support for a conjecture that requires the truth of another extremely difficult conjecture - Goldbach’s - but it is often easier to understand the nature of a proposition by analyzing the consequences that would follow, and so I hope that the generation of all integers from my weird little algorithm can further illuminate the nature of the Goldbach conjecture. It’s like “reducing one impossible problem to another equally impossible problem”, as was remarked with regards to Frey, Serre, and Ribet’s discovery of the implication of Fermat’s Last Theorem from the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture - but that was the direction from which Wiles ultimately proved it.
